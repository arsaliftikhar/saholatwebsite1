                The economist J.K. Galbraith once wrote, ‘’Faced with a choice between changing
                one’s mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy with
                the proof.’’
            </p>
            <p>
                Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: ‘’The most difficult subjects can be explained to the
                most slow-witten man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the
                simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly
                persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before
                him.’’

            <div class="article-heading">The Logic of False Beliefs</div>
            <p>
                Humans need a reasonably accurate view of the
                world in order to survive. If your model of reality is
                wildly different from the actual world, then you
                struggle to take effective actions each day. However,
                truth and accuracy are not the only things that
                matter to the human mind. Humans also seem to
                have a deep desire to belong. Understanding the
                truth of a situation is important, but so is remaining
                part of a tribe. While these two desires often work
                well together, they occasionally come into conflict.
                False beliefs can be useful in a social sense even if
                they are not useful in a factual sense. For lack of a better phrase, we might call
                this approach “factually false, but socially accurate.” When we have to choose
                between the two, people often select friends and family over facts.
            </p>

            <div class="article-heading">Facts Don’t Change Our Minds.</div>
            <div class="article-heading">Friendship Does.</div>
           <p>
               Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing
               them to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of
               losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take
               away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody
               wants their worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.
               The way to
               change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to integrate them
               into your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now, they can change their
               beliefs without the risk of being abandoned socially.
               The British philosopher
               Alain de Botton suggests that we simply share meals with those who disagree
               with us:
               “Sitting down at a table with a group of strangers has the incomparable
               and odd benefit of making it a little more difficult to hate them with impunity.
           </p>
            <p>
                Prejudice and ethnic strife feed off abstraction. However, the proximity required
                by a meal – something about handing dishes around, unfurling napkins at the
                same moment, even asking a stranger to pass the salt – disrupts our ability to
                cling to the belief that the outsiders who wear unusual clothes and speak in
                distinctive accents deserve to be sent home or assaulted. For all the large-scale
                political solutions which have been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are
                few more effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours
                than to force them to eat supper together’’
                Facts don’t change our minds.
                Friendship does.
